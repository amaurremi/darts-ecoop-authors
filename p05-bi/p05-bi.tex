\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  The artifact contains the Coq formalization of \name,  a simple calculus with
  disjoint intersection types supporting nested subtyping and composition, as described
  in the companion paper.
 \end{abstract}

% ARTIFACT: please stick to the structure of 7 sections provided below

% ARTIFACT: section on the scope of the artifact (what claims of the paper are intended to be backed by this artifact?)
\begin{scope}
  The artifact consists of the Coq sources of the mechanised semantics and proofs for \name. Every lemma and theorem
  claimed in the companion paper is backed by this artifact.
\end{scope}

% ARTIFACT: section on the contents of the artifact (code, data, etc.)
\begin{content}
The artifact package includes:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{coq} directory: Coq formalization and proofs of \name;
\item \texttt{spec} directory: Ott specification of \name;
\item \texttt{README.pdf} : Instructions of how to build the artifact.
\end{itemize}
\end{content}

% ARTIFACT: section containing links to sites holding the
% latest version of the code/data, if any
\begin{getting}
% leave empty if the artifact is only available on the DROPS server.
% otherwise, provide links to the latest version of the artifact (e.g., on github)
In addition, the artifact is also available at:
\url{https://github.com/bixuanzju/nested-composition}.
\end{getting}

% ARTIFACT: section specifying the platforms on which the artifact is known to
% work, including requirements beyond the operating system such as large
% amounts of memory or many processor cores
\begin{platforms}
  The artifact is known to work on any platform running Coq (version 8.7.2 or later).
\end{platforms}

% ARTIFACT: section specifying the license under which the artifact is
% made available
\license{BSD}

% ARTIFACT: section specifying the md5 sum of the artifact master file
% uploaded to the Dagstuhl Research Online Publication Server, enabling 
% downloaders to check that the file is the expected version and suffered 
% no damage during download.
\mdsum{2DDDF320EA677407B10949973A105EB4}

% ARTIFACT: section specifying the size of the artifact master file uploaded
% to the Dagstuhl Research Online Publication Server
